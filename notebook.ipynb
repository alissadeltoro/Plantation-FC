This project will be conducted in phases with the end goal of providing the top 3 best fit schools (i.e. Junior College, Division 1 - 3), based on aformentioned data sources. Thereafter, this project will be used to spit out insights reports for the team for use in future seasons to improve player management and demonstrate the benefits of PFC UPSL and how it acts as a jump off point to leveling up a player's soccer career.\n\n_PHASE 0: Identifying base key metrics to be acquired from players and schools used by scouts to determine interest_\n_PHASE 1: Data capture of player information via survey to club members (UPSL U19s and U17s)_\nBuilding data pipelines from NCAA, NJCAA, and \"interested\" school websites. (Using an ETL process)\n1. Data Wrangling: Website URLs to pull statistics from, additional data to be captured in-house\n- Seperated the files by statistic due to issues with parsing a full csv\n- Next step is to go back and do it from the larger csv where I splice it without issue\n- Detailed statistics can be found here: http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/rankings\n3. Data Cleaning: Transforming data into appropriate fields, types, etc. for analysis\n4. Data Storing: Create files to be used in python for future phases and model building\n\nTO-DOs:\n- Clean up school tables (e.g. name column to match)\n- Get academic information for each of the relevant schools\n- Pull in dummy player information from UPSL spreadsheet for time being\n- Update with actuals once available\n- Create a fuzzy match as a catch all for spelling character mistakes\n\nPHASE 2: Explore the data and determine key data to pull into one table for players and one table for teams\n- Data exploration using SQL and the df created in Python in Phase 1\n- Formulate foundational insights from school data (e.g. graduating seniors in position, GPA, major)\n\nPHASE 3: Weight information against acceptance rates as a soccer player & stats matching for similar player profile on team\nPHASE 4: Adjust and update accordingly to improve accuracy of model (incl. historical training data)\nPHASE 5: Automate data capture to pull in total teams in all leagues & run player profile against model to find best fit","metadata":{},"id":"bfe9f324-5988-496d-9da9-9089ca5c7e7d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## PHASE 1: DATA
